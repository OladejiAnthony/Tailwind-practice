/*
When you need to add truly custom CSS rules to a Tailwind project, the easiest approach is to just add the custom CSS to your stylesheet.
For more power, you can also use the @layer directive to add styles to Tailwind’s base, components, and utilities layers.
If you want to add your own default base styles for specific HTML elements, use the @layer directive to add those styles to Tailwind’s base layer.

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;



@layer base {
  li {
    @apply p-4; /*apply padding to all list items in the project*/
  }

  button {
    @apply text-white border bg-indigo-600 border-indigo-600 rounded-md hover:bg-transparent hover:text-indigo-600;
      /*apply these styles to all buttons in the project*/
